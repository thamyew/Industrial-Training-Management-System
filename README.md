# Industrial-Training-Management-System
This is a web application for managing students' industrial training developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. This system is used by 3 levels of user, namely admin, coordinator, and student. PHP sessions are used to allow the user data be passed from one page to another page for the purpose of user level checking. This is because some functions are only available for certain user level. Cookies are used for recording user login with an expiry time of an hour. This allows the user to access the system without needing to log in again as long as the cookies expiration time is not reached. Another functionality implemented is input validation. For example, the password entered needs to contain at least 1 special character when creating user account.
